### Hi there 👋

I am a graduate with a master's degree in Economics
and Information Technology in business. I am interested in the broad field of
data and I am currently looking for my first job precisely in this field.
I am an analytically thinking person, who likes to pay attention to
details and nuances. I have a strong desire to develop competence and
learning from experienced people.
